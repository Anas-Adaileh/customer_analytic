## Introduction
This repository houses a comprehensive customer analytics project focused on cohort analysis, RFM analysis, and machine learning models. The project aims to identify customer retention, revenue patterns, and predict future customer behavior.

## Project Goals
1. Conduct cohort analysis to understand customer retention and revenue trends.
2. Perform RFM analysis to evaluate and segment customers based on transactional behavior.
3. Build machine learning models for predicting customer spending in the next 90 days and the probability of a purchase.
4. Utilize models to identify missed opportunities, recognize potential high-value customers, and forecast future purchases.

## Data

### Data Sources
The dataset for this project is sourced from [this link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). It is a collection of all transactions between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based non-store online retail business. This dataset is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).

### Data Structure
Each row in the dataset represents a transaction for an individual item. The dataset provides a view of customer interactions during specified timeframe.

### Data Quality
The dataset have good quality attributes, characterized by completeness, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and consistency. but not recent nor updated

## Analysis

### In-Depth Python Analysis
For the detailed analysis you can access the [Jupyter notebook here](https://github.com/Anas-Adaileh/customer_analytic/blob/main/Python%20Customer%20Analytic%20Notebook.ipynb).

### Dashboard

## Results
The project yields insights into customer retention, revenue patterns, and predictive analytics. Results include identified cohort trends, RFM segmentation outcomes, and the performance metrics of machine learning models.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are derived:
1. Emulate successful strategies from the high-retention December 2010 cohort.
2. Investigate and apply insights from the August cohort for overall retention.
3. Explore the factors behind exceptional revenue in the May cohort for replication.
4. Implement targeted strategies similar to those that worked in December 2010.
5. Investigate and implement factors contributing to notable retention in the August cohort.
